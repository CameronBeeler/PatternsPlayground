Each package is an exercise in SOLID principles or Design Patterns in JAVA.
To this point, I have the following Packages:
  SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
  OCP - Open-Closed Principle
  LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
  ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
  DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
  Builder - The Builder Pattern
